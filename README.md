# Sample gitlab-ci repository for C and C++ language code.

In this repository I have created two simple classes:
1.  One C Class
2.  One C++ Class

I am using gitlab-ci.yml file in that I have provided the steps to automatically build the project which will run these classes and shows the output. The gitlab-ci.yml file have two stages build which responsible for compiling the code and generating the binaries and test which will run the binaries and shows us the output.
